# Invoice (receivable) NFT Staking 

This project demonstrates a basic Solidity smart contract that can accept an Invoice NFT (ERC721) and mint custom tokens (ERC20) equal to the face value of the Invoice.

Receivables adds up to the total current assets of a balance sheet. These are the amounts that the customers owe to the business. An outstanding Invoice is a good example of a receivable- an amount that a client owes to the business.
A business (firm), ideally wants to receive payment for all outstanding invoices as soon as possible, to restructure its working capital (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) to have more cash. 

A firm can decide to sell this invoice to another firm (a factor) for cash or take a working capital loan with the Invoice as collateral.
