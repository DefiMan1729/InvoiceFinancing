Background on Invoice Financing:

Receivables adds up to the total current assets of a balance sheet. These are the amounts that the customers owe to the business. An outstanding Invoice is a good example of a receivable- an amount that a client owes to the business.
A business (firm), ideally wants to receive payment for all outstanding invoices as soon as possible, to restructure its working capital (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) to have more cash. 

A firm can decide to sell this invoice to another firm (a factor) for cash or take a working capital loan with the Invoice as collateral.
